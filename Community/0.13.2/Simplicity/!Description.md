Simplicity

I found myself having nothing to do, so I decided to make a preset by myself. It's aim is to be simple, yet, beautiful.
It's great for screenshots, or I hope you think that way.


So, what's changed?

• Animations are slowed down to make it feel more realistic.
• Bright and foggy environment.
• Beautiful night sky.
• Changed lighting.
• Changed clouds.
